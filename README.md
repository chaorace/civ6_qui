### How to use
Download the latest release from
https://github.com/chaorace/cqui/releases/

Find your DLC folder, usually on Windows it is:  
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\DLC
```

Extract the "cqui" folder to the DLC folder

### KNOWN ISSUES:

* Attacking with cities takes two clicks on the strike button. (This is actually a bug in Civ VI)
* Minimap is too large in large UI mode and GP view is broken 
* None other thus-far!

### TODO:

* Show district adjacency bonuses in cityview or potentially globally
* Buttons for cycling cities in cityview
* Tweaking the minimap further (making it smaller or adding a smallmode?)
* Making the yields in the top panel clickable
* Right clicking ANY item in production view opens Civilopedia (currently doesn't work for disabled buildings/units)
* Hotkeys for things like: Fortify until Heal, Cycle units, etc.
* Change right clicking minimap to toggling the minimap size between small (original size) and large (current)
* Right clicking most UI elements to dismiss them, similar to how ESC behaves (diplo dialog, pop-ups, etc.)
* Condensing the City Details screen and removing tutorial elements from it
* Unit dots, fog of war colors, and other minimap options? (not sure how easy this one will be)
* Adding tooltips to the smart banner letter icons
* Adding settings for existing features (future features too!):
  1. Adding toggle for tech/civiv popup and narration (one toggle for each)
  2. Minimap tweaks

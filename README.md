# How to use
* Download the latest release from
https://github.com/chaorace/cqui/releases/

* Find your DLC folder:

  Windows:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\DLC
```
  OSX:
```
Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Civilization VI
```
  ... and then right click, "Show Package Contents", then navigate to...
```
Contents/Assets/DLC
```

* Extract the "cqui" folder to the DLC folder

* In-Game: Enable the mod in the "Additional Content" menu

* Start a new game (existing games cannot have new mods added to them!)

* Visit https://github.com/chaorace/cqui occasionally or follow https://twitter.com/realchaorace to be the first to know about new releases and feature additions!

* NOTE: Until this mod is in a less experimental state, the mod will not remember its "enabled" status after restarting the game. This means that every time you plan to start a new game using CQUI, you'll need to explicitly enable it in the "Additional Content" menu first. Once you've created the game using the mod, it will always load when you start the save, regardless of its current status in the "Additional Content Menu"
